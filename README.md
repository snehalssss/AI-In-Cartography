# AI-In-Cartography
AI-powered cartography project leveraging machine learning techniques for spatial data analysis, classification, and visualization in GIS.
AI in Cartography- This project depends on the respository of milos d popvic but the dataset used is of India 

This project explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in Cartography and GIS (Geographic Information Systems).
The goal is to enhance spatial data analysis, classification, and visualization by applying AI-driven methods such as supervised/unsupervised classification, interpolation, and feature extraction.

Features

- Integration of machine learning algorithms for spatial analysis.
- Supervised and unsupervised classification (Maximum Likelihood, K-Means, ISODATA).
- Raster operations: clipping, mosaicking, resampling.
- Vector operations: point-in-polygon, line-in-polygon analysis.
- Interpolation techniques (IDW, Kriging, Natural Neighbor, Spline).
- Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) in QGIS for remote sensing.
- 3D visualization using Rayshader and terra in R.

Languages: Python, R

Libraries/Tools:
- Python: geopandas, rasterio, scikit-learn, matplotlib, shapely
- R: rayshader, terra
- QGIS (Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin)
- ArcGIS (for comparative analysis)
